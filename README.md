# Shipment Job
Shipment Job is a [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/) addon for the gamemode [DarkRP](https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) that give players a interactive, fun, and rewarding way to make money ingame. There is an EXP system too!

Project started circa 2016?

## Prerequisites
[SligWolf's ForkLift-Truck](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=264931812) must be installed on the server (or subscribed to if installing locally)


## Manual Installation

Unzip the contents such that the ```lua```, ```resources```, etc. files are inside of a parent folder.

Take this parent folder and move it into the Garry's Mod ```addons``` directory.

The default directory is located at ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons```

Example: The ```resources``` folder is structured like so ```..\addons\shipmentjob-master\resources```

## Future Plans

1. ##### Polish it up. 

I want to finish up the core components. They all work but are not really *done...* It is not just a matter of tweaking and adjusting pricing and base model idea for players to use. 
2. ##### config.lua

I didn't want this to be considered as "polishing up" because its a feature that is for player ease of access, but still really needed. A config.lua file will allow players to easily change model for items and NPC's, prices, and text all in one file.  

3. ##### Workshop Installation

Instead of having to drag and drop file to download or update files, all you would have to do is subscribe to the workshop item. BUT... BUT, because addons like this -- I don't want to say need, but --  *Heavily Rely* on a config file I would first want to -- for ease of access -- add an options tab (in the spawn menu) to edit the config ingame. So I guess that is number 3.5 on the list?

4. ##### Level Up/Reward Screen

While the addon already has an EXP system, I want a screen for when a player levels up. There is a system in the works that displays, and rotates the item you unlocked but the fun features I want in place are still a WIP.
